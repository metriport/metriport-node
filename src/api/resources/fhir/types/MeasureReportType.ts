This may be an individual report, which provides the score for the measure for an individual member of the population; a subject-listing, which returns the list of members that meet the various criteria in the measure; a summary report, which returns a population count for each of the criteria in the measure; or a data-collection, which enables the MeasureReport to be used to exchange the data-of-interest for a quality measure.
