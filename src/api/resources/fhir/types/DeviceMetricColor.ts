 * Describes the color representation for the metric. This is often used to aid clinicians to track and identify parameter types by color. In practice, consider a Patient Monitor that has ECG/HR and Pleth for example; the parameters are displayed in different characteristic colors, such as HR-blue, BP-green, and PR and SpO2- magenta.
